==========
Yo, welcome to the WMTU diskjockey repo. This is the first pass at an all-encompassing web app to help college radio stations manage their day to day operations

#Planned Features
* Show Management
 * Archives of shows
 * Track Listings for shows
* DJ Management
 * DJ Profiles
 * Easy sign-up for semester scheduling
 * Keep track of show attendance
* Schedule Managemnt
 * Create custom weekly schedules
 * Notify DJs of upcomming shows
* Song Logging
 * DJs song logging
 * Web hook updates of track info to external services (RDS)
 * Track lists for individual shows
* Discrepancy Logging
 * Keep track of fcc discrepancy logs (swearing and the like)
* Sub Lists
 * Keep track of optted in DJs for sub requests
 * Sperate lists based on availability

There's a shit-load of stuff on this list! Most of everything will be implemented server side for the first pass. A large portion of the scaffolding is in place and just needs to be styled and connected with the rest of the application. Once the basic functionality is setup server side, a client side port will be implemented which should make the more advanced features easier to implement and more consistent, think [discourse](http://try.discourse.org). Ambitious, I know, but it should be wicked once it's mostly implemented.

Contributing
==========
If you feel that you'd like to contribute to the project feel free to fork, make your changes, and submit a PR! I'm trying to maintian some semblance of TDD so if you add features make sure they have some testing.


Thanks for stopping by!
Peace - WMTU
